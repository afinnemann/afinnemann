<h1>What's up with <code>geom_smooth</code> and additive models?</h1>

<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have ever wondered what <code>geom_smooth</code><sup>[1]</sup> actually does or been baffled by <i>generalised additive models</i> (GAMs) then this blog post is for you. It is not a comprehensive introduction but intended as an intuition-building stepping-stone into the more advanced literature. Michael Clark has written an elegant and more in-depth introductory blog<sup>[2]</sup> while Simon Wood has written the bible <sup>[Wood, 2017]</sup>. Be warned, like the new testament the book of Wood is mostly in Greek...</p>

<h2>What are generalised additive models?</h2>

<p>Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models specialized in detecting highly non-linear trends in data. In this regard, they are similar to polynomial regression which can be regarded as their main "competitor". </p>

<p>Both polynomials and GAMs perform a <i>basis expansion</i> to detect non-linear patterns. The basis is our measured variable $x$ which we expand with additional predictors to enable a non-linear fit. Formally, polynomial regression and additive models share this basic setup. <sup>[Wood, 2017]</sup></p>

<p>$y$ is our outcome variable which we assume to be drawn from a normal distribution with a mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. We model $\mu$ as a sum over functions $f(x)$. This is the <i>basis expansion</i>. The parameter $k$ controls the extend of the basis expansion and $\beta_i$ is a vector of associated coefficients. By setting $f(x) = x^i$ we have polynomial regression. In this cases $k$ controls which polynomial order we are estimating. We later see how $f_i(x)$ works differently for GAMs.</p>
<p>A central difference between GAMs and polynomials is that polynomials do <i>global</i> estimation. Essentially this means that, for instance, the data points at $x<2$ will affect the fit at $x>10$. This global property is easy to see for linear models. Like a seesaw, we cannot change the slope at $x<2$ without changing it at $x>10$. The same holds for polynomial regression. GAMs work locally and are more flexible. In the context of GAMs $k$ controls how many bins we want to carve the predictor variable up into. In GAM vocabulary the points separating each bin are called <i>knots</i> and $k$ is then the number of knots. GAMs fit a model to each bin - hence the local fit. These local models are then added together to obtain a single statistical model. Let us illustrate what this means.</p>
<p>All code for this example can be found at XXX. For our simulation we first need some data. In this simple example we consider an outcome $y$ and predictor $x$.</p>
<pre><code>n &lt;- 200
x &lt;- runif(n)
true &lt;- 4*x + 3*x^2 - 3*x^3 - 6*x^4
y &lt;- rnorm(n, true, 1.5) 
d &lt;- data.frame(x,y,true) 
</code></pre>
