<h1>What's up with <code>geom_smooth</code> and additive models?</h1>

<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have ever wondered what <code>geom_smooth</code><sup>[1]</sup> actually does or been baffled by <i>generalised additive models</i> (GAMs) then this blog post is for you. It is not a comprehensive introduction but intended as an intuition-building stepping-stone into the more advanced literature. Michael Clark has written an elegant and more in-depth introductory blog<sup>[2]</sup> while Simon Wood has written the bible <sup>[Wood, 2017]</sup>. Be warned, like the new testament the book of Wood is mostly in Greek...</p>

<h2>What are generalised additive models?</h2>

<p>Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models specialized in detecting highly non-linear trends in data. In this regard, they are similar to polynomial regression which can be regarded as their main "competitor". </p>

<p>Both polynomials and GAMs perform a <i>basis expansion</i> to detect non-linear patterns. The basis is our measured variable $x$ which we expand with additional predictors to enable a non-linear fit. Formally, polynomial regression and additive models share this basic setup. <sup>[Wood, 2017]</sup></p>
