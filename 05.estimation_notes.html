	<h1>What's up with <code>geom_smooth</code> and additive models?</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>If you have ever wondered what <code>geom_smooth</code><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> actually does or been baffled by <i>generalised additive models</i> (GAMs) then this blog post is for you. It is not a comprehensive introduction but intended as an intuition-building stepping-stone into the more advanced literature. Michael Clark has written an elegant and more in-depth introductory blog<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> while Simon Wood has written the bible <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. Be warned, like the new testament the book of Wood is mostly in Greek... </p>
		<h2>Blog structure</h2>
		<p>The blog first introduces and compares GAMs to its main competitor, polynomial regression. From there we proceed with some concrete examples where we manually replicate the functionality of <code>geom_smooth</code> and <em>mgcv</em>. Lastly, we cover the central topic of penalised estimation.</p>

		<h2>What are generalised additive models?</h2>
		<p>Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models specialized in detecting highly non-linear trends in data. In this regard, they are similar to polynomial regression which can be regarded as their main "competitor". </p>
		<p>Both polynomials and GAMs perform a <i>basis expansion</i> to detect non-linear patterns. The basis is our measured variable <i>x</i> which we expand with additional predictors to enable a non-linear fit. Formally, polynomial regression and additive models share this basic setup.</p>
