	<h1>What's up with <code>geom_smooth</code> and additive models?</h1>
	<hr>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>If you have ever wondered what <code>geom_smooth</code> <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> actually does or been baffled by <i>generalised additive models</i> (GAMs) then this blog post is for you. It is not a comprehensive introduction but intended as an intuition-building stepping-stone into the more advanced literature. Michael Clark has written an elegant and more in-depth introductory blog <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> while Simon Wood has written the bible <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup>. Be warned, like the new testament the book of Wood is mostly in Greek...</p>
		<h3>Blog structure</h3>
		<p>The blog first introduces and compares GAMs to its main competitor, polynomial regression. From there we proceed with some concrete examples where we manually replicate the functionality of <code>geom_smooth</code> and <em>mgcv</em>. Lastly, we cover the central topic of penalised estimation.</p>

		<h2>What are generalised additive models?</h2>
		<p>Generalised additive models (GAMs) are statistical models specialized in detecting highly non-linear trends in data. In this regard, they are similar to polynomial regression which can be regarded as their main "competitor".</p>
		<h3>How polynomials work</h3>
			<p>Both polynomials and GAMs perform a <i>basis expansion</i> to detect non-linear patterns. The basis is our measured variable <i>x</i> which we expand with additional predictors to enable a non-linear fit. Formally, polynomial regression and additive models share this basic setup.</p>
